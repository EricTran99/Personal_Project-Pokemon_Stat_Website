# Personal_Project-Pokemon_Stat_Website
This is fun small project in creating a website that displays stat attributes for each pokemon. In the website will contain three information with the possible expansion in the future.

The main request input command is added and will be based on the pokemon ID number, the request doesn't work for the pokemon name yet.
The first part is the creation of a bar graph which showcase the number stat for the requested pokemon, the stat is the pokemon's base stat.
the second the image of the pokemon and the name for visual clarity as most user can identify the pokemon based on the look.
the third part is a description about the pokemon, this is based on the pokedex information.

The description will be based on the bubleopedia website. The website scraping will not be used for malicious intent. This is for personal project and will not be selling the site as my own.
