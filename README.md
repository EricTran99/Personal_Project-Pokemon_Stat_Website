# Personal_Project-Pokemon_Stat_Website
This is fun small project in creating a website that displays stat attributes for each pokemon. In the website will contain three information with the possible expansion in the future.

The main request input command is added and will be based on the pokemon ID number, the request doesn't work for the pokemon name yet.<br/>
The first part is the creation of a bar graph which showcase the number stat for the requested pokemon, the stat is the pokemon's base stat.<br/>
the second the image of the pokemon and the name for visual clarity as most user can identify the pokemon based on the look.<br/>
the third part is a description about the pokemon, this is based on the pokedex information. <br/>

The description will be based on the bubleopedia website. The website scraping will not be used for malicious intent. This is for personal project and will not be selling the site as my own. <br/>

## Development process
The first part of the project stems from brainstorming in what website would I like to create. I initially want to create a site based on realistic dataset, however I'd chose to use the pokemon API as I want to learn how to import API data into html and showcase the data through a simple data visual as well as how to show the image. <br/>
The API contained examples in creating API call, so I tested it through Jupyter notebook as the easy method into making a simple call. It was to understand how the API call works and figuring out a way to create an input. <br/>
 <br/>
The next step was to think of what I want the website to have, I decided on showing four things: bar chart, image, description box & input request. This is because of the them are vastly different in how the creation works as all of the details, except for the input, are based on whatever pokemon I asked. <br/>
For the input, I chose to go for the pokemon ID number over the name. This is because the name of the pokemon were too hard to get it right and the API call needs to be accurate, otherwise it will come out with an error. Therefore, the number ID was the best one to add onto the request. <br/>
 <br/>

## Results
The result of the website is the creation in me learning html and finding ways to improve my skill as a JV developer. The website consist of simple components visually, however the process in finding out on how to make them was a challenge. The website will now showcase the pokemon's detail based on the pokemon ID and it overwrites so it doesn't stack whenever a new request is made. <br/>
 <br/>

## Note
This website creation is only meant for me to understand new ways in showing images, charts and decription from an establish data source. I'm not promoting this site as my own or for any public. This is simple a personal project which I want to do and learn.
